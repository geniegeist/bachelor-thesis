We state and prove Hairer's Reconstruction Theorem using the theory of distributions. 
We find a sufficient and necessary condition for the Reconstruction Theorem, which we call \emph{coherence}.  
The highlight is the proof of the Reconstruction Theorem with elementary distribution theory by Caravenna and Zambotti.
As an application of the Reconstruction Theorem, we extend Hölder spaces to negative Hölder exponents,
and prove the Sewing Lemma from Rough Path Theory.
